# Hoplite Polytonic Greek Keyboard -- WebExtension

Very much beta.  It will let you type polytonic Greek and also automatically changes the font of all INPUT and TEXTAREA elements to New Athena Unicode.  Tested so far in Firefox and Chrome, but should also work in other browsers which accept WebExtensions.

## Installation:
1. Download this repo
2. Install the extension as an "unpacked" extension

## Use:
The extension is disabled by default. Enable it from the browser button to the right of the search bar.
Roman keys are automatically transliterated to Greek.  
Diacritics are toggled on/off by pressing the 0-9 keys after the vowel.
